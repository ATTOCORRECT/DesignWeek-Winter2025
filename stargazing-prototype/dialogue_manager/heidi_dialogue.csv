heidi1,Hey stop running around I finished setting it up,
heidi2,Oh calm down. It was only 10 minutes. Come look through it,
heidi3,Try looking around,
heidi4,"In the first page of Grandpa’s book he wrote about a very bright star, do you see it?",
heidi5,"That’s because it is, dummy",
heidi6,The book tells us how to find the constellation from there,
heidi7,It’s supposed to make out a fish,
heidi8,"Man you suck at this, no wonder grandpa never took you stargazing",
heidi9,"Relax, it’s a joke. You just have to look at it differently. Y’know, change your perspective",
heidi10,"See? There you go. Says here grandpa found this one on the same night he got his biggest catch. Man I remember that fish, it was so good",
heidi11,"Grandpa wrote more sticky notes in the journal, look at the page with the fish",
heidi12,of course you found it that fast ,
heidi13,In the book this one is shaped like a Jellyfish,
heidi14,If you touch their underside the sting will hurt,
heidi15,Have you found the next one? The notes left seemed to have helped before,
heidi16,What's this one? I don’t see it,
heidi17,I can’t tell what it is! that's not fair,
heidi18,Woah! There’s so many of them!,
heidi19,What?! That’s so cool! I wish I could catch an octopus,
heidi20,Nevermind I don’t wanna catch one now,
heidi21,Note: limbs outstretched towards the titan of the ocean,
heidi22,This one must have been from the time grandpa got swallowed by a whale!,
heidi23,"Okay fine, but he did see a huge one!",
heidi24,What are you talking about Kole? Stars don’t just appear,
heidi25,Lemme see… Oh wow I don’t remember this one. It seems way brighter than the others,
heidi26,No that’s not what I meant when-,
heidi27,*sigh* Yeah you’re right. It has to be.,
heidi28,It’s gonna be morning soon we gotta head back,
heidi29,"Yeah, ‘course there is, it’s the sky. There’s also an empty spot in the book what are we supposed to do about that",
