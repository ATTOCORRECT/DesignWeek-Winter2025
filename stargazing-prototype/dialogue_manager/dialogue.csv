heidi1,Hey stop running around I finished setting it up,
kole1,Finally! That took you forever!,
heidi2,Oh calm down. It was only 10 minutes. Come look through it,
kole2,Wow! I can see the stars up close!,
heidi3,Try looking around,
kole3,This is so cool! It’s like millions and millions of Christmas lights!,
heidi4,"In the first page of Grandpa’s book he wrote about a red star, do you see it?",
kole4,Yeah! It looks like a giant fireball,
heidi5,"That’s because it is, dummy",
kole5,sigh,
heidi6,The book tells us how to find the constellation from there,
heidi7,It’s supposed to make out a fish,
kole6,I don’t get it. I just see a bunch of stars,
heidi8,"Man you suck at this, no wonder grandpa never took you stargazing",
kole7,Hey! You don’t have to be so mean about it,
heidi9,"Relax, it’s a joke. You just have to look at it differently. Y’know, change your perspective",
kole8,I see it! I just had to really focus on it,
heidi10,"See? There you go. Says here grandpa found this one on the same night he got his biggest catch. Man I remember that fish, it was so good",
kole9,He was the best chef in the whole world! Is there any more to find?,
heidi11,"Grandpa wrote more sticky notes in the journal, look at the page with the fish",
kole10,Found it!,
heidi12,of course you found it that fast ,
kole11,"this one looks kinda weird, I can’t tell what it is",
heidi13,In the book this one is shaped like a Jellyfish,
kole12,"Eww, those are disgusting. Doesn’t it hurt to touch them",
heidi14,If you touch their underside the sting will hurt,
kole13,I don’t want to ever touch that,
heidi15,Have you found the next one? The notes left seemed to have helped before,
kole14,I did it again!,
heidi16,What's this one? I don’t see it,
kole15,I remember seeing this one with grandpa once,
heidi17,I can’t tell what it is! that's not fair,
kole16,"Look again, try changing your perspective",
heidi18,Woah! There’s so many of them!,
kole17,This page must have been from when grandpa caught an octopus,
heidi19,What?! That’s so cool! I wish I could catch an octopus,
kole18,Yup! He came over the next day still covered in ink it was hilarious,
heidi20,Nevermind I don’t wanna catch one now,
kole19,Let’s keep looking for the next one,
heidi21,Note: limbs outstretched towards the titan of the ocean,
kole20,This is awesome!,
heidi22,This one must have been from the time grandpa got swallowed by a whale!,
kole21,You liar! He didn’t get swallowed by a whale,
heidi23,"Okay fine, but he did see a huge one!",
kole22,What the? A new one appeared! Heidi look! A new star!,
heidi24,What are you talking about Kole? Stars don’t just appear,
kole23,No really! It did I promise,
heidi25,Lemme see… Oh wow I don’t remember this one. It seems way brighter than the others,
kole24,Do you think that’s grandpa? You said he went to the sky right?,
heidi26,No that’s not what I meant when-,
kole25,"No it has to be him! Why else would he have given us his telescope, he wanted us to see him!",
heidi27,*sigh* Yeah you’re right. It has to be.,
heidi28,It’s gonna be morning soon we gotta head back,
kole26,No I wanna stay! There’s still a missing spot,
heidi29,"Yeah, ‘course there is, it’s the sky. There’s also an empty spot in the book what are we supposed to do about that",
kole27,Let’s draw grandpa’s constellation,
